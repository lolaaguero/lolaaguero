![Hi! I'm Lola](https://github.com/lolaaguero/lolaaguero/assets/134756282/0dd9619d-3e92-458a-b618-6a2bc35b231c)

Approximately 3 years ago I began my path in the IT world. I started doing software testing and analysis, got more and more involved, and now I'm learning to program.

I'm currently learning Java and JavaScript.
