![Hi! I'm Lola](https://github.com/lolaaguero/lolaaguero/assets/134756282/0dd9619d-3e92-458a-b618-6a2bc35b231c)

I don't know how I ended up getting into the IT field, but the truth's that I love it. I started doing software testing and analysis, I got more and more involved and now I want to program.

I'm currently learning test automation with Selenium (Java) and web development with JavaScript.
